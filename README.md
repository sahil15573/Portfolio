# Portfolio

Created a fully responsive and interactive personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and achievements with a clean, modern design. I focused on creating an intuitive user experience with smooth transitions, animations, and a mobile-first approach. The website includes sections like About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact Information, each designed for easy navigation. It demonstrates my ability to build clean, functional websites from scratch, incorporating best practices in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

1) Mobile-First Design: Optimized for various screen sizes with a responsive layout, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

2) Interactive Features: Developed interactive elements using JavaScript for dynamic content, including hover effects and smooth scroll.

3) Contact Form Integration: Included a simple yet functional contact form with JavaScript validation for user inquiries.
